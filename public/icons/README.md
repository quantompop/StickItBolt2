# App Icons

This directory contains application icons for different platforms.

Required for packaging:

- `icon.icns` - macOS app icon
- `icon.ico` - Windows app icon
- `icon.png` - Linux app icon (512x512 PNG)

These icons need to be created from your app logo and placed in this directory before building for production.
